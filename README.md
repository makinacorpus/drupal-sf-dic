# Drupal 7 - Symfony - Dependency injection

This project has been maturing enough to fill those needs:

 *  brings the Symfony 3 dependency injection container to Drupal 7 ;
 *  brings a Drupal 8 forward-compatibility layer for easier module porting ;
 *  brings the ability to use Symfony bundles into Drupal 7 as long as they
    use a limited set of Symfony features.

Then you may read the documentation:

 *  [Get started](Resources/docs/get-started.md)
 *  [Default services](Resources/docs/services.md)
 *  [Use Drupal 8 forms in Drupal 7](Resources/docs/forms.md)
 *  [Provide Symfony full stack and bundles in Drupal](Resources/docs/bundles.md)
 *  [Use Twig for Drupal 7](Resources/docs/twig.md)
 *  [Use Monolog and the MonologBundle](Resources/docs/monolog.md)
