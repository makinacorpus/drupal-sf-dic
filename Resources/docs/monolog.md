# Using Monolog

**This feature is experimental, enable test it before running it in production!**
Notably, formatting is broken with dblog as of now.

This module brings integration for monolog into Drupal with the condition that
you use Symfony's FrameworkBundle and MonologBundle, both being registered to
you container.

For a correct setup please follow the
[Provide Symfony full stack and bundles in Drupal](bundles.md)
documentation first.

There is two ways of it setting up:

*   either Drupal is master of logging, and monolog is just a bridge over the
    Drupal watchdog system;

*   either monolog is master of logging, and this module provides a
    ``hook_watchdog()`` implementation that fowards everything that Drupal
    catches to monolog.

You may use either one or the other, but you cannot use both at the same time.

# Installing monolog

First install the Monolog bundle dependency:

```sh
composer require symfony/monolog-bundle
```

Then add to your ``AppKernel.php`` file, in the ``registerBundles`` method:

```php
    new \Symfony\Bundle\MonologBundle\MonologBundle()
```


# Configuring Monolog

## As a bridge to Drupal watchdog

Formatter and handler implementations are provided by this module. In order to
set it up, you only need to add to you ``config.yml`` file:

```yaml
monolog:
    handlers:
        drupal:
            type: service
            id: drupal.monolog_handler
            level: warning
```

Of course, you can still add as many handlers as you wish, but beware that
since Drupal's watchdog *is not* bridged to Monolog, Drupal own's errors
won't pass into those handlers.


## As the master of things

**This is not yet implemented, will come soon!**

Set into your Drupal's ``settings.php`` file:

```php
$conf['kernel.symfony_monolog_is_master'] = true;
```

This will enable this module's ``hook_watchdog()`` implementation that will
bridge all messages to the various Monolog handlers.

Please also ensure you disabled all other Drupal logging modules, for example
using Drush:

```sh
drush -y dis dblog syslog
```

You may then proceed with advanced configuration.


## Advanced configuration

Here is a sample ``config.yml`` monolog section:

```yaml
monolog:
    handler:
        # Per default send everything to the current environment file
        main:
            type:   stream
            path:   "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"
            level:  debug
```

For a more advanced configuration, please refer to Symfony's manual:
[Logging with Monolog](https://symfony.com/doc/current/logging.html).
