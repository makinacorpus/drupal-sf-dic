Introduction
------------

`Drupal-sf-dic <https://github.com/makinacorpus/dupral-sf-dic/>`_ is a Drupal 7
module that serves the purpose of bringing the Symfony 3 dependency injection
container to Drupal 7 along with a limited Drupal 8 API compatibility layer.

This project has been maturing enough to fill those needs :

* Brings the Symfony 3 dependency injection container to Drupal 7 ;
* Brings a Drupal 8 forward-compatibility layer for easier module porting ;
* Brings the ability to use Symfony bundles into Drupal 7 as long as they use
  a limited set of Symfony features.
