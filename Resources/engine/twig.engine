/**
 * This was inspired by Twig For Drupal 7.
 *
 * But sorry for this, I do need to rewrite it fully.
 *
 * @see http://tfd7.rocks
 *   For the original code, all credits to its author, it's a really good
 *   job he did at the time. Thanks for everything!
 *
 * @see https://www.drupal.org/node/1545964
 *   If you need, at any moment in time, to create a theme with a different
 *   theme engine than it's parent, you will need the latest patches in there.
 *   Drupal does really suck when it comes down to the theme registry, I think
 *   the guys who wrote it were really drunk.

/**
 * From found template names, convert them to our specific naming convention
 * and prey for it to work.
 *
 * We have to set more pragmatically usable template names from which we may
 * derivate theme and path at runtime without performance penalty, the same
 * way Symfony does for bundle templates, by building an identifier which is
 * path agnostic, we will allow themers to use this syntax to use the 'extends',
 * 'import' or 'use' Twig directives.
 *
 * Naming convention is:
 *
 *   "@MODULE_OR_THEME_NAME/PATH/TO/FILE.html.twig"
 *
 * For example, let's say you have "funtheme" theme in the following folder:
 *
 *   "sites/all/themes/funtheme"
 *
 * And inside you have the following file:
 *
 *   "sites/all/themes/funtheme/templates/page.html.twig"
 *
 * Then its identifier will be:
 *
 *   "@funtheme/template/page.html.twig"
 *
 * Which means that, for example, you want to extend it into this file:
 *
 *   "sites/all/themes/funtheme/templates/page--some--page.html.twig"
 *
 * Then in your Twig file, you should use:
 *
 *   extends 'theme:funtheme:template/page.html.twig'
 *
 * Et voilÃ  !
 *
 * --
 *
 * Technically speaking, to make this work, we need to store into the theme
 * registry this template name into the hook info, else the theme() function
 * will use the template full path and our template name parser will throw
 * errors.
